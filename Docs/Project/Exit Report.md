##	Overview

We are trying to predict the likelihood of someone responding to a marketing campaign to purchase a MAPD (Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage) or Med Supplement Insurance Plan during the Special Election Period from Dec 8 - Sep 30 by bulding a prospect machine learning model. The team will then upload this to the marketing database and use the solution to increase effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.

##	Business Problem

Estimate the likelihood of someone purchasing a MAPD (Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage) or Med Supplement Insurance Plan during the Special Election Period from Dec 8 - Sep 30.

##	Data Processing
4 data sources -
AMLK (2017, 2018) 
Campaign Data (Who were targeted, who responded etc.)
Credit data
MACVAT
There is a lot of pre processing to remove dirty data.

##	Modeling, Validation
Tried XGBoost, Logistic Regression. XGBoost outperfromed other algorithms.
