# Final Model Report
This is the final report describing the final model to be delivered - typically comprised of one or more of the models built during the life of the project.

## Analytic Approach
* What is target definition?
The likelihood of purchasing an insurance plan
* What are inputs? All the features have been included in the data dictionary.
* What kind of model was built? Prospect Model using XGBoost

## Solution Description
* Simple solution architecture (Data sources, solution components, data flow)
* What is output?

## Data
There are 4 data sources:
* AMLK : Amerilink - Third party demographic data
* Campaign data : Data from  marketing campaign
* Credit data : aggregated to zip4 level
* MACVAT : Actuarial calculation for every medicare advantage plan

There is one dataset that contains all the data from these sources and is stored in Humana >> at-dhasandbox-central-rg >> humana â€“ Blobs >> synthetic.
There are 200000 rows and 287 columns in the dataset.

## Features
The 193 features used for modeling are:


## Algorithm
* Description or images of data flow graph
  * if AzureML, link to:
    * Training experiment
    * Scoring workflow
* What learner(s) were used?
* Learner hyper-parameters

## Results
* ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
* Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable
