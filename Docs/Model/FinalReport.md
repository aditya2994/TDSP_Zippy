This is the final report describing the final model to be delivered - typically comprised of one or more of the models built during the life of the project.

## Analytic Approach
* What is target definition
Likelihood of purchase of insurance plan
* What are inputs? All inputs are included in the data dictionary
* What kind of model was built? Prospect Model using XGBoost

## Solution Description
* Simple solution architecture (Data sources, solution components, data flow)
* What is output?

## Data
* AMLK - Amerilink - Third party demographic data. It is unethical to use race to model the data.
* Campaign data - promotion
	3 variables
	Marketing campaign sent to prospects - direct mail
